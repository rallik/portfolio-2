        "p": "Welcome to my portfolio! I love developing websites and apps that are intuitive to use, accessible to all, and responsive with the speed and flexibility that users (desktop, mobile, and every weird screen size in between) expect in 2021. I love the endless learning involved with the development process. But most of all, I love working with and receiving feedback from a team."

        "p": "A little more about me. I graduated from Boston College in May of 2020 with an Economics major and double minors in Computer Science and Marketing. Outside of development my interests stretch all over. Lacrosse took up most of my time for 10 years leading up to four years on the BC club team. Since wrapping up the athletic career, Iâ€™ve picked up photography as a hobby and an occasional side-hustle."
